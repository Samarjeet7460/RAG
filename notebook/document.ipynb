    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced framework in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Generative AI that combines the power of information retrieval with text generation. Unlike traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) that rely solely on their pre-trained knowledge, RAG enhances responses by retrieving relevant information from an external knowledge base and then generating an answer based on both the retrieved data and the modelâ€™s reasoning capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach was introduced to overcome one of the main limitations of LLMs: the tendency to produce hallucinations (incorrect or fabricated information) due to reliance only on training data. By integrating retrieval with generation, RAG provides more accurate, up-to-date, and contextually relevant answers.\n",
